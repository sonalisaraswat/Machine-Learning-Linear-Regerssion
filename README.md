# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regerssion
Linear Regression algorithm's implementation using python.
Linear Regression model for one feature and for multi featured input data.
Normal Equation implementation to find values of parameters that lower down the cost function for linear regression model.
Feature Normalisation implementation to normalise the features given as input to our model, hemce heping in making a better model for better prediction.
